# filters.py
# ----------
# This file handles filtering and graceful failure in our RAG app.
#
# The retrieval problem:
# ChromaDB always returns results — even when nothing is relevant.
# If you ask "What is the best pizza topping?", ChromaDB will still return
# the 3 "most similar" tech documents, even though none of them actually
# match. Without filtering, we'd generate a nonsense answer from unrelated docs.
#
# The solution: similarity thresholds.
# We only keep documents where the distance (dissimilarity) is below a
# cutoff value. Documents that are too far away get dropped.
#
# Graceful degradation:
# When no documents pass the filter, we don't crash — we return a helpful
# message explaining what happened. This is called "graceful degradation."

# Make sure to define a threshold value at the top if it isn't already there!
