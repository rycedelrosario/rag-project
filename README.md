# RAG Learning App

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Python, ChromaDB, SentenceTransformers, and Google Gemini. You'll build this incrementally over Weeks 10–15.

## What This App Does

You can ask this app questions about Python, machine learning, databases, APIs, and AI concepts. It finds the most relevant documents from its knowledge base and sends them to Gemini as context — so the answers are grounded in real information rather than guesswork.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd student-rag-project
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:
- **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up your Gemini API key

Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace `your-gemini-api-key-here` with your actual key.

### 5. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Assignment: Week 15 — Multi-Step AI Workflows

**Learning objective:** Understand how query quality affects retrieval, and how to improve it with LLM-powered pre-processing.

### Background

The quality of a RAG answer depends directly on what gets retrieved. And what gets retrieved depends on how similar the **query embedding** is to the **document embeddings**. If the user writes a vague or casual question, the resulting embedding may not match well with the more formal language in our documents.

Two solutions:

1. **Query rewriting**: Use an LLM to rewrite the user's question into a clearer, more specific version before embedding it. Better query → better embedding → better retrieval.

2. **Query decomposition**: Some questions are actually multiple questions. Split them and search separately, then combine results. This is called **multi-hop retrieval**.

### What to implement

**File 1 — `workflow.py`**

Implement `rewrite_query()` and `decompose_query()`. Both use Gemini to process the query before it reaches the vector store. Read the TODO comments — they explain exactly what each function should do and why.

Note: `multi_hop_retrieve()` is already implemented for you — it uses your `decompose_query()` internally.

**File 2 — `rag_pipeline.py`**

Find the **Week 15 TODO** block at the top of `run_rag()`. Add the query rewriting step before retrieval. The rewritten query gets passed to `retrieve_context()` instead of the original.

### How to test

Try a vague follow-up question:
- First ask: *"What is Python?"*
- Then ask: *"What else can it do in the real world?"*

Before your implementation: "it" doesn't get resolved and retrieval is poor. After: the rewriter uses conversation context to turn it into a specific query.

### ✅ When done
Check off **Week 15** in the Weekly Progress section above, then delete this entire Week 15 assignment section. You've built a full, production-patterned RAG system — nice work.
